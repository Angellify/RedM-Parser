This is a cleaned-up version of a chat parser tool, now released as open source. Many of you might already be familiar with its functionality from RD-RP or MD-RP, but now it's more accessible for contributions and improvements from the community.

# Features:

Parses various chat formats 
Extracts key information such as timestamps, sender IDs, and message content.
Ready for use or compilation after reviewing the source code.

# Contributions:
Contributions and feedback from the community are highly encouraged as I myself won't be updating this anytime soon.

# Usage:
To use the chat parser, simply clone the repository and build/**publish** (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/publishing-with-visual-studio?pivots=dotnet-8-0) the project yourself or run the RedMParser.exe from the build folder. Feel free to modify and customize it according to your needs, and don't forget to share your improvements with the community by submitting pull requests.

# Compiling

> [!TIP]
> For other servers looking to modify/use the chat parser, do note that actually logging any in-game chat is only possible by actually logging any chat lines in the CitizenFX Logs (RedM\RedM.app\logs). If the server you are playing on doesn't then ask the developers to add that feature.
